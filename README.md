# Download Manager ðŸ’½

This is a downloads manager written in Python. Like the description says, it works with Unix-Like systems (MacOS and Linux) and Windows. It only requires python to run, and if for some reason this isn't default, the permission to create folders and move files. The program file, download_manager.py, can be placed in any directory. The built-in os module in python will change the working directory by itself. Download Manager uses shutil, which is also built-in, to move files around. To run in the background on MacOS and Linux, run the program file using crontab or launchd. In Windows, you will have to use Task Scheduler (Suggestion: I suggest to run this periodically every minute or so). If you have any folders in the Downloads directory named "Videos", "Documents", "Images", "Installers", "Code", "Audio", "Spreadsheet", or "Unknown", the program will use these folders. If you don't want it to use these folders, either rename them or change the code to use different folder names.
